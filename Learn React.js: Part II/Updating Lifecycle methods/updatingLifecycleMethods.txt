What is updating?

The first time that a component instance renders, it does not update. A component updates every time that it renders, starting with the second render.

There are five updating lifecycle methods:

componentWillReceiveProps
shouldComponentUpdate
componentWillUpdate
render
componentDidUpdate

Whenever a component instance updates, it automatically calls all five of these methods, in order.
